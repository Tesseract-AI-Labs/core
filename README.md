## Tesseract AI: Decentralized Chest X-ray Validation and Anomaly Detection Platform

(Building for the Encode x MultiversX hackathon) - Work in progress

Tesseract AI is a groundbreaking decentralized platform striving to transform the realm of chest X-ray diagnostics through the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technologies. This platform facilitates the global collection, validation, and analysis of anonymized chest X-rays, employing advanced machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection and secondary validation by medical experts. Every interaction within the platform, from data submission to validation decisions, is immutably and transparently recorded on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity and traceability while addressing concerns of bias and reproducibility in AI-driven diagnostics.
